# personalPasswordGen
Simple password generator for personal security.

A simple python script to generate and save passwords in a .txt file.

Passwords are generated using a users selected text samples for random selection.
Text is formatted, letters are replaced with symbols, and shuffled along with a random number for
high levels of complexity and randomization.

This script automatically creates required .txt files when ran for the first time.
Includes a very basic sample text to be changed at users will, and a password document
that saves the account type along with the username to have all information in one place.

Personal security of the passwords text file is dependent on the user. 
**********  DO NOT LOSE THIS FILE!  **********

Updates are dependent on my progression in Python, as well as practicality.
